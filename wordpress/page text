MH: Monster Hunter is a third person action rpg? series where as the title says, you Hunt Monsters
You are a hunter, you usually serve as the main problem solver of your local village, which is usually "[monster] is causing problems, go deal with it".

You have 14 weapon types to choose from, and to become stronger, you need to get better armor and weapons.
And to get materials for said upgrades, you have to Hunt Monsters.

The first one came out in March 11, 2001, while the latest (Monster Hunter Rise) came out in March 26, 2021, and it's main expansion, Sunbreak, in June 30, 2022.

The games tha I've played: 
MH Generations Ultimate (MHGU)[link to page]: a collection of monsters from all previous mainline games, with it's own twists: Hunter Arts, Hunting Styles and Prowler mode
MH Rise: Sunbreak[link to page]: The "portable" 5th gen Monster Hunter pulls all stops and goes full anime with greatly increased mobility, wirebug arts and Switch Skils
(some can be traced back to MHGU's Hunter Arts and Hunting Styles), and the base game's camapign residing in a very japanese inspired village, Kamura.
The expansion does switch the main hub from Kamura to a more European themes port, Elgado, but some aspects still remain japanese, like Dango being the main meal preparation before hunts.

MHGU: A great mix of old and new
You, the hunter, are tasked to help the 4 villages of the past: [fuck I forgor so remember to list them as "Village name(game they're from)"], and Bherna, a village new to this game. 
In the Solo/Village Low Rank questline, you stumble upon to and fight the Fated Four[link to page], and end it with taking on Shagaru Magala, the monster that was MH4U's final quest monster in their low rank questline. 
After that, in High Rank Village you take to the skies, and try to investigate and hunt down Valstrax, a monster new to the expansion.

On the multiplayer side of the game, you have the Hub quests, with higher monster endurance but you get to bring up to 3 of your friends (or others on the internet) as allies to aid your hunts.
In low and high rank, your final quest to undertake is [squid], confined within it's own arena and new to this game.
In G rank (Master Rank),
